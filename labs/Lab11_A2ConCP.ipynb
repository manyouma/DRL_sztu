    "# Lab 11: A2C on CartPole with n-Step Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we implement a minimal yet fully functional version of the **Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C)** algorithm and apply it to the classic **CartPole-v1** control task.  \n",
    "A2C is one of the core policy-gradient methods where a learned value function is used as a **baseline** to reduce variance, while the actor learns a stochastic policy that maximizes expected cumulative rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike simple Monte-Carlo policy gradient, A2C supports **bootstrapped n-step returns**, which combine short-horizon rewards with value estimates of future states. This makes training more stable and significantly improves learning efficiency. In this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement an Actor–Critic network with shared representation.\n",
    "- Collect trajectories from the CartPole environment.\n",
    "- Compute **n-step bootstrapped targets** $R_t^{(n)}$.\n",
    "- Compute the **advantage** $A_t = R_t^{(n)} - V(s_t)$.\n",
    "- Update both policy and value networks using stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of A2C is intentionally kept small and readable so that you can fully understand how policy gradients and value baselines work together. Once you are familiar with the single-environment version, you can extend it to multi-environment parallel A2C, GAE(λ), or even PPO."

    "## 🧠 Step 1: The Actor–Critic Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "In A2C, the policy (actor) and the value function (critic) are implemented using a **single neural network** that shares its initial layers.  \n",
    "This design is simple, efficient, and helps both components learn better features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1  Shared Feature Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the network is a shared feed-forward module that takes in the state \\( s_t \\) and produces a latent feature vector.  \n",
    "This shared representation serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It reduces the total number of parameters  \n",
    "- It allows both actor and critic to learn from the same extracted features  \n",
    "- It stabilizes training, because both heads learn consistent representations of the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2  Policy Head (Actor)\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy head maps the shared features to a vector of **action logits**, which represent the unnormalized preferences for each action.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these logits, a categorical policy \\( \\pi(a|s) \\) is formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actor’s job:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output a probability distribution over actions  \n",
    "- Encourage exploration through stochastic sampling  \n",
    "- Adjust action probabilities based on advantage values during training  \n",

    "The critic head maps the shared features to a single scalar value \\( V(s_t) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The critic’s role:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate the expected discounted return from the current state  \n",
    "- Provide the **baseline** used to compute advantages  \n",
    "- Stabilize the actor updates by reducing variance  \n",
    "\n",
    "A good critic makes the policy gradient updates far more sample-efficient.\n",

    "## 2.4  Why Use a Shared Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing the lower layers of the network is beneficial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The actor and critic often rely on similar state features  \n",
    "- It reduces computational cost and parameter count  \n",
    "- It speeds up training  \n",
    "- It encourages the two components to learn a consistent internal representation  \n",
