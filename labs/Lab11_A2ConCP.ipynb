    "# Lab 11: A2C on CartPole with n-Step Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we implement a minimal yet fully functional version of the **Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C)** algorithm and apply it to the classic **CartPole-v1** control task.  \n",
    "A2C is one of the core policy-gradient methods where a learned value function is used as a **baseline** to reduce variance, while the actor learns a stochastic policy that maximizes expected cumulative rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike simple Monte-Carlo policy gradient, A2C supports **bootstrapped n-step returns**, which combine short-horizon rewards with value estimates of future states. This makes training more stable and significantly improves learning efficiency. In this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement an Actor–Critic network with shared representation.\n",
    "- Collect trajectories from the CartPole environment.\n",
    "- Compute **n-step bootstrapped targets** $R_t^{(n)}$.\n",
    "- Compute the **advantage** $A_t = R_t^{(n)} - V(s_t)$.\n",
    "- Update both policy and value networks using stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of A2C is intentionally kept small and readable so that you can fully understand how policy gradients and value baselines work together. Once you are familiar with the single-environment version, you can extend it to multi-environment parallel A2C, GAE(λ), or even PPO."

    "## 2.1  Shared Feature Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the network is a shared feed-forward module that takes in the state \\( s_t \\) and produces a latent feature vector.  \n",
    "This shared representation serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It reduces the total number of parameters  \n",
    "- It allows both actor and critic to learn from the same extracted features  \n",
    "- It stabilizes training, because both heads learn consistent representations of the environment\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.2  Policy Head (Actor)\n",
    "\n",
